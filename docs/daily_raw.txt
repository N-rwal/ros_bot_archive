I reviewed the materials to begin with, then I decided to make a clone of the previous work SD card.
I had to configure and update the firmware on the main router, has to be tested for WPA2 Enterprise encryption.
Did an ssh to the Lite 3 robot to confirm the ROS2 installation, then I started following the firmware update for the GO2 robot, 
it has issues interfacing with an android phone, an Iphone worked better but the configuration tripped at the network connectionto the wifi. 
Could test the AP mode on the GO2 robot next time, then change to wifi.

I tried the wireless jailbreak methods, they don't work and are confirmed down.
I'll have to patch the firmware over a physical usb-c connection, following these instructions:

I want to verify the secure-boot first, I'll need to install the rkdev tools following this:
https://wiki.theroboverse.com/firmware/secure_boot_detect
Confirmed secure-boot presence.

Flashing custom rootfs using Ubuntu by following these instructions:
https://wiki.theroboverse.com/firmware/root/custom_rootfs
Found out robot's default firmware is 1.1.9, can be downgraded to 1.1.1 with custom bootfs, pursuing.
Loaded the custom bootfs, the ssh session is now possible and I have root access.

Connect to wifi:
'ip link set wlan0 up
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -D nl80211 -c <(wpa_passphrase Realme8pro 197355555)
dhclient wlan0'
Next I'll follow the instructions to get the secondary development running:
https://github.com/legion1581/go2_firmware_tools/tree/1.1.x
ROS2 has to be installed as well ? Better research this first.
