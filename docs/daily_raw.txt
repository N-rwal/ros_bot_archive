I reviewed the materials to begin with, then I decided to make a clone of the previous work SD card.
I had to configure and update the firmware on the main router, has to be tested for WPA2 Enterprise encryption.
Did an ssh to the Lite 3 robot to confirm the ROS2 installation, then I started following the firmware update for the GO2 robot, 
it has issues interfacing with an android phone, an Iphone worked better but the configuration tripped at the network connectionto the wifi. 
Could test the AP mode on the GO2 robot next time, then change to wifi.

I tried the wireless jailbreak methods, they don't work and are confirmed down.
I'll have to patch the firmware over a physical usb-c connection, following these instructions:
https://wiki.theroboverse.com/en/firmware/root/custom_rootfs_main_page
I want to verify the secure-boot first, I'll need to install the rkdev tools following this:
https://wiki.theroboverse.com/firmware/secure_boot_detect
Confirmed secure-boot presence.
Flashing custom rootfs using Ubuntu by following these instructions:
https://wiki.theroboverse.com/firmware/root/custom_rootfs
Found out robot's default firmware is 1.1.9, can be downgraded to 1.1.1 with custom bootfs, pursuing.
Loaded the custom bootfs, the ssh session is now possible and I have root access.
Connect to wifi:
'ip link set wlan0 up
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -D nl80211 -c <(wpa_passphrase Realme8pro 197355555)
dhclient wlan0'
Next I'll follow the instructions to get the secondary development running:
https://github.com/legion1581/go2_firmware_tools/tree/1.1.x
ROS2 has to be installed as well ? Better research this first.

Will have to get ROS2 working on the bot, also look into the custom camera solution.
The camera picked is a basic Dahua model, will connect via ethernet to a RPi 5 to run the detection, then it will thrigger an alarm mechanism to the camera, all local.
Updated the firmware on the robot, up to 1.1.17.
For ROS2 we can use this project:
https://github.com/abizovnuralem/go2_ros2_sdk?ysclid=mig2xsc8om252350908
We'll use a ubuntu 22.04 RPi5 on the bot with the proposed configuration from the previous link.
Robot side ROS2 installation has to be further researched, it does not come by default.

Ubuntu 22.04 is not available on the RPi5, therefore we cannot use the reccomended ROS2 distros, I'll have to test ROS2 Jazzyin this case wit the sdk.
For the camera, I'll try using a bare RPi 5 to see if it's viable with Frigate, otherwise I'll have to set up the Hailo-26 module.
The performace is reasonable on a bare RPi5, will stick with this.
We did a tour of the mounting place for the camera setup, we'll house all the electronics in a watertight electrical box. For internet acces, 
we could either use a phone or a dedicated GSM module.
Starting the process of converting the Go2 ROS2 SDK to run on the RPi5-supported ROS2 distro.

Installed Ubuntu 24.04 on the RPi5, also ROS2 jazzy base.
Had to update the ros_bot document describing the ROS2 installation.
Pursuing with the sdk integration.
A module for the sdk uses open3d, which uses python3.11. I'll install this.
Turns out, compatibility of this SDK's used modules with the RPi5 is a nightmare, the cleanest solution would be to use a x86 CPU. If I really need to use the RPI5, I either have to re-compile a bunch of python modules for python3.12 or use some virtualisation service to 'run' Ubuntu 22.04 on top of 24.04.
The latter operation of a full ROS2 system logic for the robot might become concerning in terms of performance being virtualised.
Continuing with the RPi5, I'm working around the SDK to install it, we won't use many of it's featuresbut it should still work.
The SDK installation and it's missing modules is done, but there seems to be some connecivity issues betwen the RPI5 and the robot, I'll work on fixing this next.
