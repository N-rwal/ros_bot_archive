Day objective:


Notes:
reviewed the materials to begin with,configured and updated the firmware on the main router,ssh'd to the Lite 3 robot to confirm ROS2 installation,started following the firmware update for the GO2 robot

Results:
made a clone of the previous work SD card,tested WPA2 Enterprise encryption,tested ROS2 installation on the Lite 3 robot

Future plans:
test AP mode on the GO2 robot,change to wifi

Date:  2025-11-25T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
patch the firmware over a physical usb-c connection

Notes:
verified secure-boot presence,robot's default firmware is 1.1.9, can be downgraded to 1.1.1 with custom bootfs

Results:
flashed custom rootfs using Ubuntu,loaded the custom bootfs, ssh session possible and have root access

Future plans:
follow instructions for secondary development running,research if ROS2 needs to be installed

Date:  2025-11-26T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Get ROS2 working on the bot and look into the custom camera solution.

Notes:
The camera picked is a basic Dahua model, will connect via ethernet to a RPi 5 to run the detection, then it will trigger an alarm mechanism to the camera, all local.,Updated the firmware on the robot, up to 1.1.17.

Results:
ROS2 installation has been researched,Robot side ROS2 installation needs further research

Future plans:
Will use this project: https://github.com/abizovnuralem/go2_ros2_sdk,Will use a ubuntu 22.04 RPi5 on the bot with the proposed configuration from the previous link.


Date:  2025-11-27T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Test ROS2 Jazzy with SDK and evaluate performance on RPi5

Notes:
Ubuntu 22.04 is not available on RPi5, cannot use recommended ROS2 distros,Will test camera setup on bare RPi5 to see if viable with Frigate,Perfomance is reasonable on bare RPi5

Results:
Started process of converting Go2 ROS2 SDK to run on RPi5-supported ROS2 distro

Future plans:
Evaluate camera setup using Hailo-26 module if Frigate fails,Explore options for internet access (phone or dedicated GSM module)

Date:  2025-11-28T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Installed Ubuntu 24.04 on the RPi5 and completed ROS2 jazzy base installation.

Notes:
Had to update the ros_bot document describing the ROS2 installation.,Compatibility of this SDK's used modules with the RPi5 is a nightmare,The cleanest solution would be to use a x86 CPU

Results:
SDK installation and missing modules done,Worked around the SDK to install it on the RPi5

Future plans:
Fix connectivity issues between the RPI5 and the robot,Continuing with the RPi5, working around the SDK to install it
