Day objective:


Notes:
reviewed the materials to begin with,configured and updated the firmware on the main router,ssh'd to the Lite 3 robot to confirm ROS2 installation,
started following the firmware update for the GO2 robot

Results:
made a clone of the previous work SD card,tested WPA2 Enterprise encryption,tested ROS2 installation on the Lite 3 robot

Future plans:
test AP mode on the GO2 robot,change to wifi

Date:  2025-11-25T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
patch the firmware over a physical usb-c connection

Notes:
verified secure-boot presence,robot's default firmware is 1.1.9, can be downgraded to 1.1.1 with custom bootfs

Results:
flashed custom rootfs using Ubuntu,loaded the custom bootfs, ssh session possible and have root access

Future plans:
follow instructions for secondary development running,research if ROS2 needs to be installed

Date:  2025-11-26T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Get ROS2 working on the bot and look into the custom camera solution.

Notes:
The camera picked is a basic Dahua model, will connect via ethernet to a RPi 5 to run the detection, 
then it will trigger an alarm mechanism to the camera, all local.,Updated the firmware on the robot, up to 1.1.17.

Results:
ROS2 installation has been researched,Robot side ROS2 installation needs further research

Future plans:
Will use this project: https://github.com/abizovnuralem/go2_ros2_sdk,
Will use a ubuntu 22.04 RPi5 on the bot with the proposed configuration from the previous link.

Date:  2025-11-27T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Test ROS2 Jazzy with SDK and evaluate performance on RPi5

Notes:
Ubuntu 22.04 is not available on RPi5, cannot use recommended ROS2 distros,Will test camera setup on bare RPi5 to see if viable with Frigate,
Perfomance is reasonable on bare RPi5

Results:
Started process of converting Go2 ROS2 SDK to run on RPi5-supported ROS2 distro

Future plans:
Evaluate camera setup using Hailo-26 module if Frigate fails,Explore options for internet access (phone or dedicated GSM module)

Date:  2025-11-28T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Installed Ubuntu 24.04 on the RPi5 and completed ROS2 jazzy base installation.

Notes:
Had to update the ros_bot document describing the ROS2 installation.,Compatibility of this SDK's used modules with the RPi5 is a nightmare,
The cleanest solution would be to use a x86 CPU

Results:
SDK installation and missing modules done,Worked around the SDK to install it on the RPi5

Future plans:
Fix connectivity issues between the RPI5 and the robot,Continuing with the RPi5, working around the SDK to install it

Date:  2025-12-01T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Picking up from the last week, our goal for today is to control the robot using the ROS2 teleop-keyboard.

Notes:
As much as I like digging code, we need to confirm the operation of the hardware first, before development.,For this testing phase, 
I'll briefly load up the proper configuration on a x86 computer.,I installed the full recommended setup for ROS2 'humble', 
but there's no connection with the robot still.,We could try to use the official sdk to see whether it works.. 
For it, we'll need to downgrade the robot's version to 1.1.11 again though.

Results:
I prepared the robot today for the following tests.

Future plans:


Date:  2025-12-02T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
installed the sdk on the x86 computer and using the right dds middleware

Notes:
ROS2 support is lacking,Made modifications to unitree's setup script to adapt to our version,Updated driver for Lidar to newer hardware needed

Results:
Robot now responding to universal /cmd_vel ROS2 topics,Position data for Rviz2 and camera feed working,Cut down default launch script, 
only using nodes of interest in our project

Future plans:
Recreate this on the RPi5 but need to work out version mismatches

Date:  2025-12-03T00:00:00.000-05:00

Day objective:
Recover previous work, deploy launch script from RPi5 and potentially research Lidar driver versions

Notes:
Assumption: The RPi5 doesn't work with keyboard teleop's/cmd_vel because of updated standards between humble and jazzy.,
Testing the same setup as yesterday with the simple or default script doesn't seem to work anymore.,
The DDS service got reset apparently after a reboot.

Results:
Lidar driver found at https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unilidar_sdk2

Future plans:
Try cross developing using jazzy on a x86 as well, since it might be compatibility issue
